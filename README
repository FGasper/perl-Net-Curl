This package is working and the interface is mostly stable.

** WARNING **
- pushopt() may disappear yet.


** TODO **

XS:
- under coro and threads, when forcibly destroyed, there are some ways to
  make it leak or double-free memory, must be investigated further.

Easy:
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
- write more documentation

Form:
- implement read callback
- write more documentation

Multi:
- write more documentation

Share:
- write more documentation

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
